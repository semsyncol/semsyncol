# Semantic Syntax Coloring

A universal and meaningful syntax coloring scheme for all programming languages.

#### What
This universal syntax coloring scheme is designed to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. By adhering to consistent principles and using intuitive color associations, it ensures that developers can easily transition between languages while maintaining clarity and focus. 
And yes, colors were chosen based on their psychological associations, contrast, and accessibility.

#### Why
* **Clarity:** By assigning distinct colors to different syntax elements, developers can quickly identify their roles in the code.
* **Readability:** A well-designed color scheme reduces cognitive load, making it easier to scan and understand code at a glance.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast to support for colorblind users.
* **Minimalism:** Avoid overly bright or clashing colors to reduce eye strain.
* **Consistency:** Using the same colors across languages ensures familiarity, even when switching between different programming environments.
* **Adaptability:** Easy to tweak for new languages.
